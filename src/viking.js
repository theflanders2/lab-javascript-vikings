// should receive the health property as its 1st argument
// should receive the strength property as its 2nd argument
// attack() method
// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should return the strength property of the Soldier
// receiveDamage() method
// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (the damage)
// should remove the received damage from the health property
// shouldn't return anything

// Viking
// A Viking is a Soldier with an additional property, their name. They also have a different receiveDamage() method and a new method, battleCry().

// Modify the Viking class, have it inherit from Soldier, re-implement the receiveDamage() method for Viking, and add a new battleCry() method.

// inheritance
// Viking should extend Soldier
// class

// (This method should be inherited from Soldier, no need to re-implement it.)

// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should return the strength property of the Viking
// receiveDamage() method
// This method needs to be re-implemented for Viking because the Viking version needs to have different return values.

// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (the damage)
// should remove the received damage from the health property
// if the Viking is still alive, it should return "NAME has received DAMAGE points of damage"
// if the Viking dies, it should return "NAME has died in act of combat"
// battleCry() method
// Learn more about battle cries.

// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should return "Odin Owns You All!"

// Saxon
// A Saxon is a weaker kind of Soldier. Unlike a Viking, a Saxon has no name. Their receiveDamage() method will also be different than the original Soldier version.

// Modify the Saxon, constructor function, have it inherit from Soldier and re-implement the receiveDamage() method for Saxon.

// Saxon should extend Soldier

// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (the damage)
// should remove the received damage from the health property
// if the Saxon is still alive, it should return "A Saxon has received DAMAGE points of damage"
// if the Saxon dies, it should return "A Saxon has died in combat"

// War
// Now we get to the good stuff: WAR! Our War class will allow us to have a Viking army and a Saxon army that battle each other.

// addViking()
// addSaxon()
// vikingAttack()
// saxonAttack()
// showStatus()

// class
// When we first create a War, the armies should be empty. We will add soldiers to the armies later.

// should receive 0 arguments
// should assign an empty array to the vikingArmy property
// should assign an empty array to the saxonArmy property
// addViking() method
// Adds 1 Viking to the vikingArmy. If you want a 10 Viking army, you need to call this 10 times.

// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (a Viking object)
// should add the received Viking to the army
// shouldn't return anything
// addSaxon() method
// The Saxon version of addViking().

// should be a function
// should receive 1 argument (a Saxon object)
// should add the received Saxon to the army
// shouldn't return anything

// vikingAttack() method
// A Saxon (chosen at random) has their receiveDamage() method called with the damage equal to the strength of a Viking (also chosen at random). This should only perform a single attack and the Saxon doesn't get to attack back.

// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should make a Saxon receiveDamage() equal to the strength of a Viking
// should remove dead Saxons from the army
// should return result of calling receiveDamage() of a Saxon with the strength of a Viking
// saxonAttack() method
// The Saxon version of vikingAttack(). A Viking receives damage equal to the strength of a Saxon.

// should be a function
// should receive 0 arguments
// should make a Viking receiveDamage() equal to the strength of a Saxon
// should remove dead Vikings from the army
